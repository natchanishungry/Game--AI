The scene to play is called 'SampleScene' in the Assets/Scenes/ folder. 

I thought that the 'smartest' player would perform as many trading actions as it could before going back to the caravan, and so therefore my heuristic motivates the player to do just this. 

The world state is represented with two arrays, one which holds the current inventory, and one which holds the current caravan. 

Goal State is for each array index of caravan to be 2.

I defined the following actions:
Trade with trader 1
Trade with trader 2
Trade with trader 3
Trade with trader 4
Trade with trader 5
Trade with trader 6
Trade with trader 7
Trade with trader 8
drop spices at caravan
Pick spices up from caravan
